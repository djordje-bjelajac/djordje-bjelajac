# Hi there, I'm Đorđe 👋

I'm a Software Engineer based in Berlin, originally from Bosnia and Herzegovina. I love solving meaningful problems through code, and I'm always curious about how things work—be it in software, life, or art.

- 🏗️ **DevOps & Infra** – Terraform, CI/CD automation, and simplifying environments
- 🧪 **Test & Refactor** – I appreciate solid, readable code that doesn’t break when touched

## 💡 What I’m Into
