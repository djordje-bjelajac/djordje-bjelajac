# Hi there, I'm Đorđe 👋

I'm a Senior Software Engineer based in Berlin, originally from Bosnia and Herzegovina. I love solving meaningful problems through code, and I'm always curious about how things work—be it in software, life, or art.

## 🧠 What I Do

- 🧩 **Build systems** with clarity, domain thinking, and clean boundaries
- 📊 **Trade ideas** with algorithms – working on a short-term crypto trading bot
- 🛠️ **Design APIs** that make sense – recent focus on statistics endpoints, groupings, and roles
- 🏗️ **DevOps & Infra** – Terraform, CI/CD automation, and simplifying environments
- 🧪 **Test & Refactor** – I appreciate solid, readable code that doesn’t break when touched

## 💡 What I’m Into

- 🧘‍♂️ Yoga, 🏃‍♂️ HIIT, and 🥊 Muay Thai (training for body & mind)
- 🧠 Philosophy, 📚 literature, and 🎧 building thematic playlists
- ⚙️ Autonomy, financial independence, and building tools that free people from busywork
- 🛵 Planning to ride a classic motorcycle around Europe (Ducati Sport 1000 Biposto is the dream!)
